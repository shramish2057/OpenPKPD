# OpenPKPD

Transparent, validated pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics modeling infrastructure.

## What this is

OpenPKPD is a reference-grade PK and PD simulation platform intended for research, method development, and reproducible scientific computation.

It is not a GUI product and not a regulatory submission tool.

## Repo layout

- core: Julia core engine, models, solvers, PD, population simulation
- interfaces: CLI and Python bindings
- serialization: model and execution artifacts
- validation: reference models and equivalence tests
- benchmarks: performance and numerical benchmarks
- docs: technical documentation
- examples: reproducible examples
- tests: test harness

## Status

Early scaffolding.
