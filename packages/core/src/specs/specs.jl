- dR/dt = kreg × (R_baseline - R) + regulation_effect

Regulation effect (drug-induced change):
- Down-regulation: regulation_effect = -kdown × E_drug × R
- Up-regulation: regulation_effect = +kup × E_drug × (Rmax - R)

Net effect:
- E_net = E0 + R × E_drug  (receptor amplifies/attenuates drug effect)

Parameters:
- E0: Baseline effect
- Emax: Maximum drug effect on receptors
- EC50: EC50 for drug effect
- gamma: Hill coefficient
- R_baseline: Baseline receptor density (normalized, typically 1.0)
- kreg: Receptor return-to-baseline rate constant
- Rmax: Maximum receptor density (for up-regulation, typically > R_baseline)
- kchange: Rate of receptor change (kdown for down-regulation, kup for up-regulation)
- direction: :down for down-regulation, :up for up-regulation

Clinical Applications:
- Beta-receptor down-regulation with chronic agonist exposure
- Opioid receptor adaptation
- Hormone receptor regulation
